# 🚧 Portfolio Restoration Status

## ✅ What's Currently Working:
Your portfolio is running but in a **simplified version**

## 🎯 Original Portfolio Had:
1. ✅ Hero section with gradient icon
2. ✅ Animated typewriter role text  
3. ✅ About section with experience stats
4. ✅ Skills grid (8 categories)
5. ✅ Projects with expandable feature cards
6. ✅ Certifications grid
7. ✅ Awards section
8. ✅ Contact with social buttons
9. ✅ Responsive design (mobile/tablet/desktop)
10. ✅ Smooth scrolling navigation
11. ✅ Custom app bar
12. ✅ Floating action button

## 📝 Files Created So Far:
✅ pubspec.yaml - Dependencies
✅ app_constants.dart - Your info
✅ app_colors.dart - Theme colors
✅ app_theme.dart - Complete theme
✅ responsive_utils.dart - Responsive helpers
✅ skill_model.dart - All 8 skill categories
✅ project_model.dart - PeopleFirst & NiyantranPro
✅ certification_model.dart - 5 certs + 3 awards
✅ skill_card.dart - Skill display widget
✅ section_title.dart - Section headers
✅ main.dart - Basic running version

## 🚧 Still Need to Create:
- Animated role text widget
- Hero section (complete)
- About section with stats cards
- Projects section with expandable cards
- Certifications section
- Contact section
- Custom app bar with navigation
- Main.dart with all sections integrated

## 💡 Options:

###  Option 1: I Continue Building (15 mins)
I'll recreate ALL remaining files to match the original professional portfolio

### Option 2: Quick Enhancement
I enhance the current working version with key features step by step

### Option 3: You Tell Me Priority
Tell me which section is most important and I'll perfect that first

**What would you like me to do?** The current version works but doesn't have all the beautiful features yet! 🚀
